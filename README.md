# GraphQL Workshop 1 - An Introduction to GraphQL

This is a repo to go along with the Introduction to GraphQL workshop.

## Application overview

It contains a sample app which consists of a GraphQL server and a Create React App. It stores TV shows and movies you would like to see, and stores a flag to show if you have got round to watching them or not.

Apollo Server is used on the backend and Apollo Client is used on the front end. Data is stored by node.js accessing a JSON file.

## Get up and running

### Install

To begin, go to the *stage-1-init* branch (`git checkout stage-1-init`) and run `yarn`.

### Run

Use the `yarn start` command from the root directory. It will start both the backend GraphQL server and frontend Create React App.

## Branches

The app is split into multiple branches, each representing a stage in the workshop.

The init stage is the application at a state where a GraphQL concept can be added to either the front or back end to further enhance app functionality, and the final stage is the completed code for that stage. 

* *stage-1-init* - **start here**
* *stage-2-init*
* *stage-2-final*
* *stage-3-init*
* *stage-3-final*
* *stage-4-init*
* *stage-4-final*
* *stage-5-init*
